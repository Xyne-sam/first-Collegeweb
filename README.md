# 🎓 College Website Project

Welcome to my first semester project — a **fully functional college website** designed and developed **solo** by me, **Sam aka Sumit**, a BCA student at **Patliputra University**.

## About the Project

This project is a comprehensive college website that includes:

-  College introduction and vision
-  College Main Page  
-  Courses and programs Offered  
-  Faculty Profiles  
-  Academic Calendar  
-  Notices & Announcements  
-  Contact Page  
-  Gallery Page
-  Login page with Sign-up Functionality


The goal was to make the web development fundamentals and getting deep into Web Functionality.
Everything you see here was built by me in my **first semester**, out of pure passion and curiosity.

**Fun Fact**: I built this entirely in my first semester, with zero external help — just curiosity, late nights, and a lot of Hard Work, and getting knowledge from Google!
